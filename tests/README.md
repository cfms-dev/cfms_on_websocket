# CFMS WebSocket Server - Test Suite

This directory contains the automated test suite for the CFMS (Confidential File Management System) WebSocket server.

## Overview

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the server's functionality, including:

- **Basic Server Functionality**: Connection handling, server info, and error handling
- **Authentication**: Login, token management, and session handling
- **Document Management**: Create, read, update, delete operations for documents
- **Directory Management**: Directory listing, creation, and deletion
- **User Management**: User CRUD operations and permissions
- **Group Management**: Group CRUD operations and permission management

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have:

1. Python 3.14 or higher installed
2. All project dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   uv sync --upgrade --dev
   ```

## Running Tests

The test suite backs up `src/config.toml` before writing a test configuration
and restores it at session teardown. SQLite data and generated runtime files
are recreated during integration tests. If `src/app.db` exists, create a
consistent runtime snapshot before invoking pytest:

```powershell
uv run --locked python .codex/skills/maintain-cfms-python/scripts/snapshot_test_state.py
```

The printed snapshot directory may contain credentials and must be treated as
sensitive. Restoring it is an explicit manual operation.

### Run All Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Run Specific Test Files

```bash
# Test basic functionality
uv run pytest tests/test_basic.py

# Test document operations
uv run pytest tests/test_documents.py

# Test directory operations
uv run pytest tests/test_directories.py

# Test user management
uv run pytest tests/test_users.py

# Test group management
uv run pytest tests/test_groups.py
```

### Run Specific Test Classes or Functions

```bash
# Run a specific test class
pytest tests/test_basic.py::TestAuthentication

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/test_basic.py::TestAuthentication::test_login_success
```

### Run Tests with Verbose Output

```bash
pytest -v
```

### Run Tests and Show Print Statements

```bash
pytest -s
```

### Run a WebSocket Stress Smoke Test

```bash
uv run python -m tests.stress.ws_load --users 50 --duration 60 --scenario mixed --json
```

## Test Structure

### Test Client (`test_client.py`)

The `CFMSTestClient` class provides a convenient interface for interacting with the server during tests. It handles:

- WebSocket connection management
- Request/response formatting
- Authentication token management
- Common API operations

### Search Test Layers

- `test_search.py` exercises the public WebSocket contract, including
  authentication, the global search permission, result shape, filtering before
  pagination, cursor behavior, sorting, and validation.
- `test_search_queries.py` exercises object visibility directly against a
  disposable SQLite database. It covers object access entries, compiled access
  rules, inheritance boundaries, and user blocks without reading or writing the
  integration server's `app.db`.

Keep protocol gates and response assertions in the integration layer. Put
complex SQL visibility combinations in the disposable-database layer, using
real models and persisted rows rather than mocked SQLAlchemy query chains.

Example usage:

```python
from tests.test_client import CFMSTestClient

# Create and connect client
with CFMSTestClient() as client:
    # Login
    response = client.login("admin", "password")
    
    # Create a document
    response = client.create_document("My Document")
```

## Writing New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. Place them in the appropriate test file (or create a new one)
2. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
3. Use fixtures for common setup and teardown
4. Clean up any resources created during tests
5. Assert on both success and failure cases
6. Document complex test scenarios

Example:

```python
def test_my_new_feature(authenticated_client: CFMSTestClient):
    """Test description explaining what this test verifies."""
    # Arrange
    data = {"key": "value"}
    
    # Act
    response = authenticated_client.some_operation(data)
    
    # Assert
    assert response["code"] == 200
    assert "expected_field" in response["data"]
```

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines. The test suite:

- Automatically starts and stops the server
- Cleans up resources after each test
- Provides clear error messages for debugging
- Can run in isolation or as a full suite

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

If tests fail because the server won't start:

1. Check that `config.toml` exists (it will be created from `config.toml.sample`)
2. Ensure the SSL certificate directory exists: `mkdir -p content/ssl`
3. Check for port conflicts (default: 5104)

### Tests Fail Intermittently

If tests fail randomly:

1. Increase the server startup wait time in `conftest.py`
2. Check for resource cleanup issues
3. Ensure tests are properly isolated

### Authentication Errors

If authentication tests fail:

1. Verify `admin_password.txt` is being created
2. Check that the database is being initialized properly
3. Ensure the token is being properly stored and passed

## Contributing

When contributing tests:

1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
3. Add appropriate assertions for both success and error cases
4. Document any special setup or requirements
5. Run the full test suite before submitting changes

## License

These tests are part of the CFMS project and follow the same license as the main project.
